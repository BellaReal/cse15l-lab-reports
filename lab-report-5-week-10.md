# Comparing Two Implementations of MarkdownParse
## By Isabella Real

# Finding Differences
In order to more easily reference and view the results of the tests, I ran the command `bash script.sh > results.txt` which saved the output of running script.sh into a new file called results.txt.  I did this in both my repository as well as the provided repository in order to compare the output of the different implementations. To compare the different test results, I used the `vimdiff` command on the results.txt files in different repositories to be able to view the files side by side.

Two differences in the results of test cases are when these files are tested:
1. [194.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/194.md)
2. [201.md]([201.md](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/201.md)
